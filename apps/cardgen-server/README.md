A widget utility to generate live discord cards for portfolios or github README.
## ðŸ¤” How to use
- The utility can be self hosted and run like any other typescript application. It requires a discord application token and a running redis instance to operate. <br>
- Use the [.env.example](https://github.com/DarkFalc0n/cardgen/blob/master/.env.example) file to generate your own .env file in the environment
> To unlock full functionality, that is, to enable rich presence display in the cards, the discord application/bot needs to share a discord server/guild with the user.

## ðŸ–‡ Endpoints
  ```
  /api/discord/<DISCORD_USER_ID>
  ```
The output is as follows: <br>

Passing the style parameter will give the following result:
  ```
  /api/discord/<DISCORD_USER_ID>?style=full
  ```
